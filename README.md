# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-Librosa-
# Methodology 
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing 
o Collect a dataset of speech recordings labeled with corresponding emotions. 
o Load and preprocess these sound files using the Librosa and Soundfile libraries to ensure 
they are in a suitable format for feature extraction. 
2. Feature Extraction 
o Extract relevant audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), 
chroma, and spectral contrast using Librosa. 
o Compile these features into a structured format suitable for input into the MLP classifier. 
3. Model Training 
o Utilize the sklearn library to define and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier on 
the extracted features. 
o Implement cross-validation and parameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
4. Evaluation and Analysis 
o Evaluate the trained MLP classifier using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score. 
o Analyze the results to understand the model's strengths and limitations in recognizing 
speech emotions.
