# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-Librosa-
# Introduction
In the digital age, understanding human emotions through speech can enhance numerous applications, 
from customer service to mental health monitoring. The Speech Emotion Recognition with Librosa 
project aims to leverage audio processing techniques to detect and classify emotions from speech using 
the powerful Python libraries Librosa, Soundfile, and sklearn. This project will serve as an introduction to 
audio processing, feature extraction, and machine learning, paving the way for more advanced 
applications such as deep learning-based emotion recognition systems.

# Methodology  
## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing 
 1. Collected a dataset of speech recordings labeled with corresponding emotions. 
 2. Loaded and preprocessed these sound files using the Librosa and Soundfile libraries to ensure 
  they are in a suitable format for feature extraction. 
## 2. Feature Extraction 
1. Extracted relevant audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), 
chroma, and spectral contrast using Librosa. 
2. Compileed these features into a structured format suitable for input into the MLP classifier. 
## 3. Model Training 
1. Utilize the sklearn library to define and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier on 
the extracted features. 
2. Implement cross-validation and parameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

## 4. Evaluation and Analysis 
1. Evaluated the trained MLP classifier using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score.

# Tools and Technologies 
1 Librosa: For audio processing and feature extraction. 
2 Soundfile: For reading and writing sound files. 
3 sklearn: For machine learning model development and evaluation. 
4 Python: As the programming language to integrate these libraries and implement the project.
